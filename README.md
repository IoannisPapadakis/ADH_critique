This reanalyzes the findings of Autor, Dorn, and Hanson's 2013 paper "The China Syndrome" using their data with slight modifications to their code. These results are published as a working paper here:
Rothwell, Jonathan T., Cutting the Losses: Reassessing the Costs of Import Competition to Workers and Communities (February 8, 2017). Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2920188

This file uses data downloaded from Autor, Dorn, Hanson's 2013 American Economic Review article: "The China Syndrome", using data & code from Dorn: http://www.ddorn.net/data.htm, which is also available from the journal page: 
https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.103.6.2121

To extend their analysis from 2007 to 2011, I use data from Daron Acemoglu, David Autor, David Dorn, Gordon H. Hanson, and Brendan Price, "Import Competition and the Great US Employment Sag of the 2000s" Journal of Labor Economics, Vol. 34, No. S1.
These authors created a similar CZ-level measure of import competition. Dorn's homepage also publishes these data and the relevant code.

This is the STATA code I use to re-analyze ADH's data. It is used to produce Appendix Table 1 in Rothwell (2017) & serves as the basis for Table 3, which summarizes those results.
